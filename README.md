# Cycle TODO DWIM (Do What I Mean) command `cycle-todo-dwim`

This plugin adds only one command named `cycle-todo-dwim`. This commands works
exactly as the default "Rotate the TODO state" command when a block doesn't have
a repeating SCHEDULED/DEADLINE. When it has a repeating timestamp, instead of
changing the state to DONE it updates the timestamp and sets the TODO state to
TODO/LATER.
